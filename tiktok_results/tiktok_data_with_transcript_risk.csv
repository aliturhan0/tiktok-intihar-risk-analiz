depression,"You feel like nobody cares… even when they do.” In this emotional moment, Hayden Hurst opens up about depression, addiction, and feeling alone — even with love around him. He didn’t want to explain why his life was unraveling… he just wanted the pain to stop. But he’s still here. Because somewhere along the way, he got a second chance. If you’re in that place — keep fighting. There is someone who loves you. You’re not alone.

It's hard to unless you go through it, but depression, when you...  You feel like nobody's there, despite my family being so close, and they're willing to do whatever.  But when you're in that headspace and you're in that dark spot, you do, you feel alone.  You feel like nobody's there, nobody cares. So I guess for me in those years,  that's why I turned to drinking and pills and anything that I could give my hands on  to numb that feeling of embarrassment where I wouldn't have to explain myself to my family  as to why my life was like unraveling. I just, I'd fought for so long and I just,  I wanted it to be over. And for some reason, I got a second chance at this thing.  Just having that support system in moments like that is just, it's crucial.  You don't know which way is up. You know, you're looking for help any way you can get it. And  um, keep fighting, keep going. Because as bad as, as dark as it gets, I promise you  there's someone out there who cares and loves you and wants to see you succeed at whatever you do.  It doesn't have to be professional sports. You know, I promise you there's somebody out there  in your life that loves you and that will support you and will help you get out of that situation.","I can't really explain it.
